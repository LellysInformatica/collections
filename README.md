# Collections

Collections Abstraction library for PHP

The Collection library is one of the most useful things that many modern languages have, but for some reason PHP doesn't have a built in collection layer.

For that reason we created Collections, an incredible library that gathers the best of `.NET's` and Java's collections patterns and unify it with PHP array power.

Take a look and see what we're talking about!!
